It was created to solve the problem of juggling multiple documents containing prose, character profiles, plot outlines, research notes, and worldbuilding systems. Novelize pulls this data into an integrated drafting environment in which the user can write the prose of their story with access to sidebars containing the references they'll need during the writing process.<br><br>Other drafting software are costly, outdated, and overcomplicated. Novelize is a free, easy-to-use application with a clean and modern UI. It's focused solely on the act of writing the novel so that user can flow through the process seamlessly.<br><br>You can log in to the site using the following credentials, but please be respectful of the data associated with this test account:<br><ul><li class='project-text'> Username: user@test.com </li><li class='project-text'> Password: password</li></ul>",
